jQuery antihighlgiht
========================

Overview
--------
antihighlight is a jQuery plugin based on <a href="https://github.com/mistic100/jQuery-highlightTextarea">jQuery.highlightTextArea</a>. It allows you to highlight words and sentences inside of &lt;textarea&gt; and &lt;input&gt; elements.

It accepts a whitelist of letters and words. If any letters in the textarea are not on an
approved list, those are highlighted. For remaining words with all valid letters, any words
not on the whitelist are highlighted.

This library is used to make leveled early reading books, where it is important not to use any
unfamiliar letters or words.
